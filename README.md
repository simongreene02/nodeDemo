# Program Setup

The program requires access to a localhost MySQL database with the username `root`, the password `password`, and the name `demodata`.

The database can be imported from the file `db.sql`, or the Python program `populate.py` can be run to generate a set of commands to generate the tables and populate it with entries.

# Run Program

The program can be run using the command `node .` in the main directory, generating a server that runs on the url `localhost:8192` by default.
